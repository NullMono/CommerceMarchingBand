        What you should know about the inaugural Tiger Town Throwdown Marching Band Competition:
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The Triple T competition will be for smaller classifications only including A-AAA size bands. There are many contests that are open to groups of all sizes, and those are wonderful, but our competition gives the smaller sized groups a chance to perform later in the day as well as being able to compete with groups that are generally their same size. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We will utilize Olympic Style Judging including 5 band judges who will adjudicate all facets of each performance. The lowest score will not be counted in the final outcome of the total score for each band. We will also have separate judges for percussion, colorguard, majorettes, and drum majors. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Percussion, colorguard, drum major, and majorettes will also receive GMEA ratings and all competing groups will be ranked in each category. There is no limit to how many majorettes you need to be adjudicated. All majorettes will receive comments, ratings, and rankings regardless of the size of the group. There are also no limitations or rules against using fire batons on our field. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br></p>
    <div class="infoTitle"><p>SPECIFIC RULES AND REGULATIONS:</p></div>
    <p>
        The competition field will be the size of a standard regulation football field with yard lines, hash marks, and sidelines marked. The home and away bleachers are aluminum and are very close to the field for optimal projection for smaller bands. Our field is a grass field. Yard markers will not be utilized during the event. Our sideline is very close to the fence separating the bleachers from the field, which makes projection fantastic without a track or yards of sideline space to have to deal with. 
        <br>
        <br>
        There will be power available on the sideline at the 50 yard line for those ensembles that need it, but everyone should bring their own extension cords and surge protectors if necessary. 
        <br>
        <br>
        </p><div class="infoTitle"><p>
        Bands will be classified according to the number of wind players. Bands may enter a higher classification, but may not enter a lower classification. Here are the classification details:
                <br>
                <br>
                
                   CLASS A–up to 40 winds
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   CLASS AA–41-59 winds
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   CLASS AAA- 60-79 winds
                   </p></div>
        <p>
        <br>
        <br>
        CLASS AAAA, AAAAA, and beyond may not register for this event. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Bands will be scheduled every 20 minutes. Every group will need to enter, set up, perform, and exit the field in their allotted time. There will be a penalty of .1(one tenth) of a point for each minute an ensemble happens to go over their 20 minute time frame barring any major issues out of the control of the ensemble. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Order of performance will be determined by the postmark date of each completed application including the registration fee and performance bond fees. The earliest received application will compete the latest in each classification. 
        <br>
        <br>
        All performing ensembles will need to be in uniform unless we have inclement weather or an emergency or major issue. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The "Triple T" competition utilizes olympic style judging with 5 band judges. The lowest score will be disregarded and the remaining 4 scores will be combined for an overall band score. Each adjudication sheet is based on a 100 point total. The areas of adjudication are as follows: Music- 40pts, Visual- 30pts, Overall Effect- 30pts. 
        <br>
        <br>
        All percussion, colorguard, majorettes, and drum majors scores will be taken into consideration by the adjudication panel when considering their final scores. These specialized areas will receive comments, scores, ratings, and rankings from specific adjudicators for each section. 
        <br>
        <br>
